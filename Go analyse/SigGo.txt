Term: adaptive immune response based on somatic recombination of immune
    receptors built from immunoglobulin superfamily domains
Ontology: BP
Definition: An immune response mediated by lymphocytes expressing
    specific receptors for antigen produced through a somatic
    diversification process that includes somatic recombination of
    germline gene segments encoding immunoglobulin superfamily domains.
    Recombined receptors for antigen encoded by immunoglobulin
    superfamily domains include T cell receptors and immunoglobulins
    (antibodies) produced by B cells. The first encounter with antigen
    elicits a primary immune response that is slow and not of great
    magnitude. T and B cells selected by antigen become activated and
    undergo clonal expansion. A fraction of antigen-reactive T and B
    cells become memory cells, whereas others differentiate into
    effector cells. The memory cells generated during the primary
    response enable a much faster and stronger secondary immune
    response upon subsequent exposures to the same antigen
    (immunological memory). An example of this is the adaptive immune
    response found in Mus musculus.
